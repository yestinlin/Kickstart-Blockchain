# Kickstart_Blockchain
 A solidity based webapp built using React. This application is a mockup of Kickstarter using Blockchain and smart contracts.

#The Challenge
To increase transparency and stop fraudulent activities in the start-up industry and on platforms created around it up until now, including Kickstarter. There is no assurance that those who post projects on Kickstarter will follow through with them, use the funding to carry them out, or produce finished products that live up to the expectations of their backers. An innovative Kickstarter mockup solved the issue and was created with Solidity-written smart contracts, Nextjs and Reactjs were used to develop the app.
